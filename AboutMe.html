    <h1>About me</h1>
    <strong>

Hi! My name is Daniel. I am 16 years old and I live in Brazil.  
I am currently studying technology and programming, focusing on web development and Python.  

I enjoy building simple and interactive websites, creating scripts and small games, and experimenting with new projects to improve my skills.  
I am also taking two courses from Bradesco to expand my knowledge and apply what I learn in practice.  

In this portfolio, I organize my projects and experiments so I can track my progress and share my work with others.  
Feel free to explore the projects and check out my codes!
